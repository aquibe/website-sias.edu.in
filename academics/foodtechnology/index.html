                        Safi Institute Of Advanced Study -The Department of Food Technology was established in the year 2011 with a mission to provide quality education experience in food technology through enhancing fundamental skill development and practical knowledge in food technology in order to prepare students for various positions in global industries, for advanced studies and to conduct basic and applied research in food science and technology for ultimate benefit of our nation. The vision of the food technology department is to enhance our department through trans-disciplinary approaches for safe, sustainable and healthy foods through innovative research, teaching and industrial outreach. Later, in 2015 a post graduate programme in food science and technology was started.

                        Objective of this course is to provide students an in-depth knowledge of the scientific and technical approaches which are required to understand the nature of raw food materials. This course helps students in understanding the basic concepts such as composition of food, food and nutrition, physicochemical and microbiological properties. It also helps students in learning different techniques related to food processing and preservation of food.

                    <h4 class="text1">
                        The program includes study of various courses like Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Nutrition, Food Engineering, Food analysis, Food packaging, Technology of fruits and vegetables, cereals, plantation crops etc

                    <h4 class="text1">
                        Apart from theoretical knowledge we provide experiential learning opportunities for students such as workshops, certificate courses and industrial visit. In plant training in a food industry and dissertation for a period of three months is mandatory for the successful completion of graduation which makes our candidates a perfect fit to the various job opportunities.
